.. _Kepler: https://2sn.org/kepler/doc/
A repository of tools for dealing with and analyzing X-ray burst data from
Kepler_.  Many scientists that have access to
Kepler develop often redundant code for carrying out similar analysis, sometimes
making inconsistent choices.  The goal of this repository is to offer these
scientist space to contribute such code and collaborate on developing robust
tools that will save future scientists time.
