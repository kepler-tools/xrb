# This is my stab at a class I've been wanted for a long while: DefinedDict.
#
# DefinedDict is a restricted variation on Python's dict.  It has a defined set
# of keys/fields that is established on creation and cannot be changed
# afterward.  However, the data the keys point to CAN be updated.  I subclass
# Mapping instead of MutableMapping because MM suggests the ability to add,
# change, remove keys, which I don't want to do.
#
# In developing this and discussing with others, I've come across possible
# alternatives to writing your own class.  None quite gave me what I wanted, but
# for reference check out: `attrs`, `recordclass`, and the new builtin
# dataclasses.  The issues with these include: not quite achieving what I want,
# introducing dependencies without enough of a payoff, and/or requiring as much
# effort to achieve what I want as writing DefinedDict.
#
# TODO: use that __hasattr__ to make mydefdict['key'] and mydefdict.key both
# work?
#
# TODO: __slots__ is a magic that signals a fixed set of attributes will be
# used, instead of the usual __dict__ that allows for adding an arbitrary
# number of attributes and implies a decent amount of overhead.  If this class
# proves a good case, might use this instead to be more memory efficient.
# Mapping may already implement this for us.
#
# Python's documentation and source provides useful info on implementing
# containers, though sadly not a single StackOverflow answer pointed to these
# docs.  I stumbled upon them after much frustration.
# See S 3.3.7 of:
# https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects
# In addition, see the source of UserDict, Mapping, MutableMapping. _Environ in
# os module is an example of a MutableMapping implementation.
#
# Recommended methods to implement (* provided by MutableMapping (** abstract)):
#   **keys(), *values(), *items(), *get(), clear(), setdefault(), pop(), popitem(),
#   copy(), and update()
#   __*contains__(), **__iter__(), **__len__(), **__getitem__(),__missing__(),
#   **__setitem__(), **__delitem__(), __repr__(), __str__(), __format__()
#
# Some details on some methods:
#object.__getitem__(self, key)
#Called to implement evaluation of self[key]. [negative keys handled by __getitem__()]. 
#   If key is of an inappropriate type, TypeError may be raised; if of a value outside the set of indexes for the sequence (after any special interpretation of negative values), IndexError should be raised. 
#   For mapping types, if key is missing (not in the container), KeyError should be raised.
#
#   Note for loops expect that an IndexError will be raised for illegal indexes to allow proper detection of the end of the sequence.
#
#object.__missing__(self, key)
#Called by dict.__getitem__() to implement self[key] for dict subclasses when key is not in the dictionary.
#
#object.__setitem__(self, key, value)
#Called to implement assignment to self[key]. Same note as for __getitem__(). 
#This should only be implemented for mappings if the objects support changes to the values for keys, or if new keys can be added, or for sequences if elements can be replaced. 
#The same exceptions should be raised for improper key values as for the __getitem__() method.
#
#object.__delitem__(self, key)
#Called to implement deletion of self[key]. Same note as for __getitem__(). 
#This should only be implemented for mappings if the objects support removal of keys, or for sequences if elements can be removed from the sequence. 
#The same exceptions should be raised for improper key values as for the __getitem__() method.
#
#object.__iter__(self)
#This method is called when an iterator is required for a container. This method should return a new iterator object that can iterate over all the objects in the container. For mappings, it should iterate over the keys of the container.
#
#The membership test operators (in and not in) are normally implemented as an iteration through a sequence. However, container objects can supply the following special method with a more efficient implementation, which also does not require the object be a sequence.
#
#object.__contains__(self, item)
#Called to implement membership test operators. Should return true if item is in self, false otherwise. 
#For mapping objects, this should consider the keys of the mapping rather than the values or the key-item pairs.
#
#For objects that donâ€™t define __contains__(), the membership test first tries iteration via __iter__(), then the old sequence iteration protocol via __getitem__(), see this section in the language reference.
#
# 
# NOTE: Implementation strategy, start with what Mapping gives, take what you
# need from MutableMapping, UserDict
#
# TODO: Implement type hinting for dict items?
# TODO: Enforce key to be string?
